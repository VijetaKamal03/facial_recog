# facial_recog
Facial recognition and real-time functionality as a secure verification mechanism to check the activities of bots that try to assume human status was designed, developed, and tested. The real-time functionality is premised on the human user’s ability to complete trivial tasks.

PROPOSED_WORKFLOW:
The  user  initiates  the  authentication  process  by  providingtheir username. The system prompts the user to capture a real-time  facial  image  for  facial  recognition.  Simultaneously,  theuser  is  presented  with  real-time  tasks  to  complete,  ensuringthe  human  element  in  the  authentication  process.  The  facialrecognition  module  verifies  the  user’s  identity  based  on  the captured  facial  features.  The  completion  of  real-time  tasksand  facial  recognition  triggers  the  generation  of  a  dynamicCAPTCHA  challenge.  The  user  responds  to  the  CAPTCHAchallenge,  which  is  then  verified  by  the  system.  Successfulcompletion of all verification steps grants the user access.
